# MCP Endpoint Migration Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED: Endpoint Migration from /mcp/v2 to /mcp

### Changes Made

#### 1. **Server Configuration Updated**
- **File**: `mcp-service/src/server/server.ts`
- **Change**: Updated route mounting from `/mcp/` to `/mcp` (removed trailing slash)
- **Change**: Updated server startup logging to show correct endpoint URLs

#### 2. **Documentation Updated**
All documentation files have been updated to use the new `/mcp` endpoint:

- **README.md**: 
  - Updated API endpoints section
  - Updated all curl examples for capabilities, crawl, and crawlWithMarkdown tools
  - Changed from `/mcp/v2` to `/mcp`

- **MCP_API.md**:
  - Updated endpoint specifications 
  - Updated HTTP request examples
  - Updated all curl command examples
  - Changed from `/mcp/v2` to `/mcp`

- **OVERVIEW.md**:
  - Updated API endpoints section
  - Updated key concepts documentation
  - Updated usage examples
  - Changed from `/mcp/v2` to `/mcp`

#### 3. **Server Verification**
✅ **Server builds successfully** (`npm run build`)
✅ **Server starts correctly** - Logs show:
```
MCP SSE endpoint (deprecated): http://localhost:3000/mcp/sse
MCP Streamable HTTP endpoint (recommended): http://localhost:3000/mcp
Health check endpoint: http://localhost:3000/api/health
Version info endpoint: http://localhost:3000/api/version
```

### Benefits of This Change

1. **Better Compatibility**: Removed version suffix `/v2` for better compatibility with MCP clients
2. **Cleaner API**: Standard `/mcp` endpoint is more intuitive and follows REST conventions
3. **Future-Proof**: Easier to maintain without version-specific paths
4. **Documentation Consistency**: All documentation now accurately reflects the actual endpoints

### Current Endpoint Structure

- **Modern MCP (Recommended)**: `POST /mcp` - Streamable HTTP transport
- **Legacy MCP (Deprecated)**: `POST /mcp/sse` - Server-Sent Events transport  
- **Health Check**: `GET /api/health`
- **Version Info**: `GET /api/version`

### Testing

The server is currently running and responding correctly to requests:
- Health endpoint confirmed working
- Server logs show all endpoints are properly configured
- No compilation errors or runtime issues

### Migration Complete ✅

The migration from `/mcp/v2` to `/mcp` has been successfully completed with:
- ✅ Code changes implemented
- ✅ Documentation fully updated  
- ✅ Server building and running correctly
- ✅ All endpoints properly configured
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

The Webcrawl-MCP server now uses standard, compatible endpoint paths that will work better with MCP clients and services.
